## Hi there 👋

<!--
**clarissa-dev-codes/clarissa-dev-codes** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a few different personal projects as well as projects for classes
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and refreshing myself on Python
- 💬 Ask me about my trackers and my ideas for other projects
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: 
      - I ride and compete in Equestrian Western Cutting  
      - I have a small obsession with my goats and growing my herd  
      - I would rather code in Python than C++
